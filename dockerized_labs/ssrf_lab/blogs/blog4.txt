SSRF in Cloud Environments

SSRF has become increasingly critical in cloud environments:

1. Cloud Service Provider Metadata
- Access to instance metadata
- Retrieval of cloud credentials
- Service discovery

2. Container Environments
- Access to kubelet API
- Docker API exploitation
- Service mesh vulnerabilities

3. Serverless Functions
- Internal service discovery
- Function chaining
- Environment information disclosure

4. Mitigation Strategies
- Use IMDSv2 for AWS
- Implement proper RBAC
- Network segmentation
- Strong access controls
